# BAZAAR - self-audit

*A deliberately hostile audit of this repo's own claims. Every row was checked by
running the command or reading the cited code - not by trusting the prose. Status
is one of **VERIFIED** (reproduced here), **PARTIAL** (verified except for a step
that needs external secrets), or **UNVERIFIED**. Re-run any command yourself.*

## Method

Ran `make test / benchmark / fuzz / train / verify / live-fake` and
`python scripts/ap2_demo.py`; read `verifier/gate.py`, `razorpay/client.py`,
`adapters/ap2.py`, `catalog/attestation.py`, `crypto/signing.py`. Statuses come
from executed output or a cited code line.

## Claims

| # | Claim | Status | Reproduce / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 94 tests pass (41 unit · 3 property · 6 security · 44 integration) | **VERIFIED** | `make test` |
| 2 | Gate blocks 100% of 9 attack classes with the correct reason code; 0% false-block | **VERIFIED** | `make benchmark` |
| 3 | Property fuzzer: 0 spend-cap violations, 0 escapes over 20,000 states | **VERIFIED** | `make fuzz` |
| 4 | The deterministic gate was **not modified** by any upgrade | **VERIFIED** | `git log --oneline -- backend/bazaar/verifier/gate.py` → one commit (original) |
| 5 | Risk brain precision/recall/F1 = 1.00 on held-out **360 attacks + 900 legit**; Brier 0.038 | **VERIFIED** | `make train`; `docs/eval/risk_eval.json` |
| 6 | Noise-robustness curve degrades smoothly (recall → ~0.82 at σ=1.0) | **VERIFIED** | `make train`; `docs/eval/noise_robustness.png` |
| 7 | Leave-one-class-out: single-invariant classes do not transfer (model catches essentially none of an unseen class) | **VERIFIED** | `make train` |
| 8 | Risk model is advisory / tighten-only - it can never widen authority | **VERIFIED** | `tests/property/test_spend_cap_invariant.py::test_risk_never_widens_authority` |
| 9 | The risk & verifier layers import nothing from the LLM/agent layer | **VERIFIED** | `tests/security/test_module_boundary.py` |
| 10 | AP2 rail verifies a **real ES256** Cart Mandate; 1/1 legit, 5/5 tampers, at the right layer | **VERIFIED** | `python scripts/ap2_demo.py`; `adapters/ap2.py` (`algorithms=["ES256"]`) |
| 11 | Merchant-as-signer: Ed25519 price attestations; two-sided; `dual_signed=true` | **VERIFIED** | `tests/unit/test_attestation.py`; AP2 legit run |
| 12 | Trust Receipt signed; tamper -> invalid; audit log hash-chained & tamper-evident | **VERIFIED** | `make verify` |
| 13 | Issuer-key pinning - a compromised agent cannot self-issue a bigger mandate | **VERIFIED** | policy attack → `MANDATE_IMMUTABLE` in `make benchmark` |
| 14 | No hand-rolled crypto (Ed25519 via libsodium; ES256 via PyJWT/cryptography; JCS via rfc8785) | **VERIFIED** | `crypto/signing.py`, `adapters/ap2.py`, `backend/pyproject.toml` |
| 15 | AOV +7.72%, 100% of upsold orders still cleared the gate (simulated A/B) | **VERIFIED** | `make benchmark`; framed as simulated in `docs/EVAL.md` |
| 16 | Razorpay settlement **logic**: order, idempotency, reconcile, "ambiguous = NOT PAID", refuses non-`rzp_test_` keys | **VERIFIED** | `make live-fake`; `razorpay/client.py` guardrail; 8 webhook/settlement tests |
| 17 | **One real live Test Mode payment on api.razorpay.com** | **PARTIAL** | Needs your `rzp_test_` keys + an interactive test-card payment. Logic verified via `make live-fake`; the real run is `make live` (yours). Not reproducible from the repo alone. |

**No fabricated numbers were found.** The only item not reproducible without
external secrets is #17, and the README already frames it as "reproduce with your
own keys."

## Honest caveats (limits)

1. **Same generator, different seed.** The held-out set uses fresh keys and unseen
   instances, but the *same* synthetic generators. It tests instance/signature
   generalization, **not** distribution shift.
2. **A deterministic rule classifies these perfectly - the gate does.** So the
   model's 1.00 is *not* evidence it beats rules. Its value is calibration + a soft
   advisory layer. **The verifier, not the model, is the security boundary.**
3. **The live payment is operator-run.** It is real, but it lives outside the
   keyless test suite (keys + an interactive card).

## Verdict

Everything except the live network payment reproduces from this repo with one
command each; the live payment reproduces with your own Test Mode keys. The
project makes **no claim it does not back with a runnable command**, and it states
its limitations openly (`README.md` → *Known limitations*).

# BAZAAR - submission one-pager

**Razorpay AI Buildathon 2026 · Track 01 - AI Growth & Agentic Commerce**

One sentence: **BAZAAR is a deterministic authorization gate that lets an AI agent
transact on Razorpay Test Mode while making it impossible for the agent to
overspend, replay a payment, pay a tampered price, leave its category, or be
steered by injected text - and it proves each block with a machine-readable
reason code, a signed receipt, and a tamper-evident audit log - and it now also
accepts a real AP2 Cart Mandate from an AI buyer and settles it through the same gate.**

## Track 01's bar, met line by line

The track asks: *"Every money action explainable, bounded and gated. Show the
audit trail and one failure handled gracefully."*

| The bar          | How BAZAAR meets it                                                                 | See it |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Explainable**  | Every decision is a fixed checklist; every block returns one of nine reason codes, not "the AI decided." | `make showcase` beat 3 |
| **Bounded**      | Spend is capped by a human-signed mandate; negotiation is clamped between the buyer cap and the seller floor; nothing probabilistic can raise a limit. | `make showcase` beat 1 |
| **Gated**        | One deterministic verifier authorizes money. The LLM and the risk model may only *tighten* (NORMAL → REVIEW → BLOCK), never widen authority. | `backend/bazaar/verifier/gate.py` |
| **Audit trail**  | Every authorization emits an Ed25519-signed Trust Receipt; each audit entry hash-chains the previous one, so editing any past entry is detected. | `make showcase` beat 4, `make verify` |
| **One failure, gracefully** | The Razorpay ambiguous window (order created, capture not yet confirmed) defaults to **NOT PAID**, reconciles from Razorpay as the source of truth, and **never re-charges**. | `make live`, webhook tests |

## Beyond the bar: sellable to a real AI buyer, two-sided integrity

- **AP2 rail.** BAZAAR verifies a real **ES256 Cart Mandate** (Google's Agent Payments Protocol) - registered signer, unexpired, self-consistent - then settles it through the *same* untouched gate. `make ap2`: **1/1** legit clears, **5/5** tampers caught (price / over-budget at the money gate; expired / signature / rogue-signer at AP2 verification, before the gate). This is the Track's *"make a merchant transactable by an AI buyer end to end,"* with a genuine protocol.
- **Merchant-as-signer.** The merchant signs a price attestation (Ed25519) over the price it will honor; when it verifies, the gate authorizes against that merchant-signed price and marks the receipt dual-signed. Both sides are signed - the buyer's issuer-pinned mandate and the merchant's price - and the gate enforces the authorized amount against the merchant-of-record price, so tampering the mandate fails its signature (`MANDATE_IMMUTABLE`) and tampering the price fails the gate's price check (`PRICE_MISMATCH_MERCHANT_RECORD`).

## Prove every claim - the commands

```bash
make setup        # venv + install + init db
make test         # 93 tests: unit + property + security + integration
make fuzz         # property-based fuzzer vs the spend-cap invariant -> real count
make benchmark    # regenerate datasets, run gate + fuzzer -> the scoreboard
make latency      # time one real authorization through the gate -> p50/p99, real
make train        # train + evaluate the calibrated risk brain -> artifact + plots
make ap2          # AP2 rail conformance: real ES256 Cart Mandates (1/1, 5/5)
make showcase     # the whole story in one paced, recordable run
make verify       # receipt verify/tamper + audit-chain verify/tamper
make live         # ONE real Razorpay Test Mode payment, end to end
```

## The numbers (reproduce with `make benchmark`)

| Number                                                     | Value        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Adversarial block rate (144 attacks, 9 classes)            | **100%**, correct reason code every time |
| False-block rate on legitimate traffic (400, incl. edges)  | **0%**       |
| Held-out (72 fresh, unseen attacks)                        | **100%** block, 0% false-block |
| Fuzzer spend-cap violations (20,000 random states)         | **0**        |
| Escapes                                                    | **0** (honestly counted; a real one would be printed) |
| AOV uplift from bounded upsell / share still gated         | **+7.72% / 100%** (a controlled A/B on simulated buyers - see `docs/EVAL.md`) |
| Advisory risk classifier - **calibrated** (reported *separately*)  | precision **1.00**, recall **1.00**, F1 **1.00**, Brier **0.038** |
| AP2 rail conformance (real ES256 Cart Mandates)            | **1/1** legit cleared, **5/5** tampers caught |
| Authorization latency, full 11-check gate (via `make latency`) | **~0.13 ms** p50, sub-millisecond p99, ~**7,000**/sec on one core |

**On the risk model:** it is a **calibrated** logistic classifier (Brier 0.038) that
can only *tighten* an ALLOW to a human-review hold - it never authorizes and never
widens authority. It reaches recall 1.00 at **zero** false positives, with
interpretable per-feature weights, so the advisory signal is now genuinely useful
rather than nearly blind (it was a 0.22-recall heuristic before). The deterministic
gate remains the sole authorizer; a leave-one-attack-class-out probe (in
`docs/eval/RISK_BRAIN.md`) reports honestly where a learned layer does and does not
transfer - single-invariant classes stay the gate's job, by design.

**Methodology (so it's defensible, not theatre):** the held-out set is **360
attacks + 900 legit**, generated independently with fresh signing keys. Because
these synthetic classes are separable by construction, a clean-data 1.00 is
*expected* - so the eval also reports a **noise-robustness curve** (recall falls to
~0.82 under noise), a **leave-one-class-out** limit, and an **out-of-distribution**
test (a different generator) where the advisory model's recall honestly **drops to
0.63 while the deterministic gate still blocks 100%**. That is the thesis in one
number: the model is not the security boundary; the verifier is. Counts, curves and
generation method are in `docs/eval/RISK_BRAIN.md`.

## Nine attacks → nine reason codes

| Attack | Reason code |
|--------|-------------|
| Spend above the signed cap        | `MANDATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` |
| Rewrite the mandate / self-issue one | `MANDATE_IMMUTABLE` |
| False or post-auth price change    | `PRICE_MISMATCH_MERCHANT_RECORD` |
| Replay a nonce                     | `NONCE_REPLAY` |
| Resubmit a paid transaction        | `DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION` |
| Buy off-mandate category           | `CATEGORY_OUTSIDE_MANDATE` |
| Prompt injection in catalog text   | `UNTRUSTED_INSTRUCTION` |
| Transact while frozen              | `AGENT_FROZEN` |
| Use an expired mandate             | `MANDATE_EXPIRED` |

## What makes it credible under questioning

- **Deterministic, not a model judge.** The alternative design, asking an LLM
  "should this payment go through," is exactly what BAZAAR rejects: it is
  non-reproducible, only as bounded as its prompt, and vulnerable to the same
  prompt injection the agent faces. The gate is a pure function instead, so the
  same input gives the same verdict every run, the reason is one of nine codes
  rather than prose, and one decision costs **~0.13 ms** rather than a network
  round-trip. The model runs alongside and may only *tighten*, never authorize.
- **Issuer-key pinning.** The buyer agent holds **no** mandate-signing key. The
  verifier pins the mandate to a trusted human/issuer key, so a compromised agent
  cannot mint its own mandate with a bigger cap - the signature must be the
  issuer's, not the agent's. This is what makes "the agent cannot escalate its own
  authority" literally true, not merely asserted.
- **Schema-level defenses.** Nonce uniqueness (replay) and idempotency (double
  charge) live in the database schema, so a code path cannot forget them.
- **No hand-rolled crypto.** Ed25519 via libsodium (PyNaCl); RFC 8785 canonical
  JSON via `rfc8785`.
- **No fabricated numbers, ever.** Anything not produced by a real run reads
  `UNVERIFIED`. Every figure above regenerates from a command.

## Deliberately out of scope (named, not half-built)

No full marketplace, reputation graph, blockchain, custom agent protocol,
multi-round negotiation, or real money. Settlement is Razorpay **Test Mode** only.
These are stated as future work so the built parts can be finished to a high bar
rather than many parts left partial.

"""DB-backed authorization service - the live adapter around the pure gate.

Flow for one transaction:
  1. read live state from the DB (nonce used? idempotency key used? agent frozen?)
  2. run the pure deterministic gate  -> authoritative decision + reason code
  3. compute the advisory risk signal  -> may tighten the *effective* decision only
  4. on ALLOW: reserve the nonce and record the transaction. The DB UNIQUE
     constraints are the final word: if a race slipped past step 1, the INSERT
     fails and we downgrade to the correct reason code (defense in depth).
  5. sign a Trust Receipt and append a hash-chained audit entry - always.

The deterministic reason code is what gets recorded and measured. The risk signal
is surfaced for display/escalation but never rewrites a deterministic reason.
